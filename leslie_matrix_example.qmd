## Leslie matrix example

Model population changes using the same example we did in lecture.

```{r}

# Can do it in 2 steps, by making a vector then making the matrix, but we are doing it at once

insect_leslie <- matrix(c(0, 0, 600, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.08, 0),
                        nrow = 3, 
                        ncol = 3, 
                        byrow = TRUE)

```


```{r}
# initial condition
insect_y0 <- c(12000, 700, 500)
```


```{r}

insect_y1 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y0

insect_y1

```

Estimate populations at each life stage at year 2 and year 3

```{r}

insect_y2 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y1

insect_y3 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y2

insect_y2
insect_y3

```
